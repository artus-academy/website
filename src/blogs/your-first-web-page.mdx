Every website you see on the internet starts with one simple technology: **HTML**. If you want to become a web developer, learning HTML is your first and most important step.

In this blog, you will learn how to create your **first web page** using basic HTML and understand how each part works.

---

## What is HTML?

HTML stands for **HyperText Markup Language**. It is used to **structure** content on the web.

With HTML, you can:

* Show text
* Add images
* Create links
* Build forms
* Organize content

HTML does not add design or logic. It only tells the browser **what to display**.

---

## Basic Structure of an HTML Page

Every HTML page follows a simple structure. Here is a basic example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Page</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>This is my first website.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

Let's understand each part step by step.

---

## Understanding Each Tag

### 1. `<!DOCTYPE html>`

This tells the browser that the document is written in **HTML5**. It helps the browser display the page correctly.

---

### 2. `<html>` Tag

The `<html>` tag is the main container of your webpage. All other content stays inside this tag.

---

### 3. `<head>` Section

The `<head>` section contains information about the page. It is not shown directly on the screen.

Inside `<head>`, we usually add:

* Page title
* Meta information
* Links to CSS files

Example:

```html
<head>
  <title>My First Page</title>
</head>
```

---

### 4. `<title>` Tag

The `<title>` tag sets the name of your webpage. It appears on the browser tab.

Example:

```html
<title>My Website</title>
```

---

### 5. `<body>` Section

The `<body>` tag contains everything that appears on the screen.

This is where you write your main content.

---

### 6. Heading Tag `<h1>`

The `<h1>` tag is used for the main heading.

Example:

```html
<h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
```

There are also `<h2>` to `<h6>` for smaller headings.

---

### 7. Paragraph Tag `<p>`

The `<p>` tag is used to write normal text.

Example:

```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```

## How to Create Your First Web Page

Follow these simple steps:

### Step 1: Open a Text Editor

You can use:

* Notepad (For beginnners) 
* VS Code (Best for want to be developers) - [Download link](http://code.visualstudio.com/download)

---

### Step 2: Write the HTML Code

Open your text editor, create a file then copy and paste this code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My First Website</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello, I am Learning Web Development</h1>
  <p>This is my first HTML page.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

<ImageMdx src="/images/blogs/your-first-web-page/02-copy-paste.jpeg" alt="VS Code after copy pasting code" title="Code copy pasted onto VS Code" />

---

### Step 3: Save the File

Save the file as:

```
index.html
```

<ImageMdx src="/images/blogs/your-first-web-page/03-file-save.jpeg" alt="Click File -> Save" title="Click File -> Save" />
<ImageMdx src="/images/blogs/your-first-web-page/04-save-dialog.jpeg" alt="Make sure the name is index.html" title="Make sure the name is index.html" />

Make sure the extension is `.html`.

---

### Step 4: Open in Browser

Double-click the file or right-click and open it with any browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).

<ImageMdx src="/images/blogs/your-first-web-page/05-explorer.jpeg" alt="Double click the file" title="Open your explorer and double click the file" />

You will see your first website on the screen.

<ImageMdx src="/images/blogs/your-first-web-page/06-final-result.jpeg" alt="Output of the code" title="Output of the code" />

## Practice Exercise

Try doing these tasks:

1. Change the heading text
2. Add your name
3. Write a short introduction
4. Change the title of the page

Example:

```html
<h1>Hi, I am Nikhil</h1>
<p>I am learning web development at ArtUs Academy.</p>
```

---

## Common Beginner Mistakes

### ❌ Forgetting Closing Tags

Wrong:

```html
<p>Hello
```

Correct:

```html
<p>Hello</p>
```

---

### ❌ Saving Without .html Extension

Always save your file as `.html`, not `.txt`.

---

### ❌ Writing Code Outside `<body>`

Visible content must be inside the `<body>` tag.

## Why HTML is Important

Learning HTML helps you:

* Understand how websites work
* Learn CSS and JavaScript easily
* Build React projects faster
* Create real projects

Strong basics = Better developer 🚀

These topics will help you build complete websites.
